# Todo App

This is a simple Todo app created using Expo and Node.js. It allows you to create, update, and delete tasks in a to-do list. This project is a great starting point for learning how to build mobile applications with Expo and a Node.js backend.

## Features

- Create new tasks.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks.
- View your list of tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)
- Your favorite code editor.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd todo-app
Install the server dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm install
Install the client dependencies:

bash
Copy code

npm install
Usage
Starting the Server
Go to the server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
Start the Node.js server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

Running the Expo Client
Go to the client directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../client
Start the Expo client:

Copy code
expo start
Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device, scan the QR code, and you'll be able to use the Todo app.



## Code Syntax Highlighting with Prism.js

This project utilizes [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) to provide code syntax highlighting for code blocks or other content in the app. Prism.js is a lightweight and highly customizable syntax highlighter that supports various programming languages and styles.

### How to Use Prism.js

If you want to include code syntax highlighting in your project, follow these steps:

1. Include the Prism.js CSS and JavaScript files in your project. You can download them from the [official Prism.js website](https://prismjs.com/download.html) or include them from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

   ```html
   <!-- Include Prism.js CSS in your HTML file -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/prism.css">

   <!-- Include Prism.js JavaScript in your HTML file -->
   <script src="path/to/prism.js"></script>
Add code blocks to your app's content using the following format:

html
Copy code
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Your code here
</code></pre>
Replace "language-javascript" with the appropriate language class for your code block. Prism.js supports a wide range of languages, such as javascript, python, html, and more.

When you run your app, Prism.js will automatically apply syntax highlighting to the code blocks based on the specified language class.

Customizing Prism.js
You can customize Prism.js to match the theme and style of your app by modifying the CSS or using one of the available themes. Prism.js provides extensive documentation and tools for customization. Feel free to explore the Prism.js documentation for more information on customization.

By incorporating Prism.js into your project, you can make your code examples and technical content more visually appealing and easier to read.
